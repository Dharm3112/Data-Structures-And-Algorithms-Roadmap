## 📌 The Checklist

**Phase 1: Foundations**
- [ ] Language Basics (Syntax, Loops, Classes)
- [ ] Linear DSA (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
- [ ] Non-Linear DSA (Trees, Graphs)

**Phase 2: Algorithms**
- [ ] Searching (Binary Search, BFS, DFS)
- [ ] Sorting (Merge, Quick, Bubble)
- [ ] Recursion & Backtracking

**Phase 3: Optimization Patterns**
